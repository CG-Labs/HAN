# HAN

The source code of Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (WWW-2019).

The source code is based on [GAT](https://github.com/PetarV-/GAT) 

# How to preprocess DBLP? 

Demo: preprocess_dblp.py

# Q&A

1. ACM_3025 in our experiments is based on the preprocessed version ACM in other paper (\data\ACM\ACM.mat). Subject is just like Neural Network, Multi-Object Optimization and Face Recognition. In ACM3025, PLP is actually PSP. You can find it in our code.
2. In ACM, train+val+test < node_num. That is because our model is a semi-supervised model which only need a few labels to optimize our model. The num of node can be found in meta-path based adj mat.
